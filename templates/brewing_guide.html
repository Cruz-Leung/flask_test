            <p class="lead mb-4">Welcome to the world of home brewing</p>
            <p>If you’re just getting started with making coffee at home, you’re in the right place. Brewing great coffee isn’t about expensive equipment or complicated techniques — it’s about understanding a few simple principles. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know, in clear, beginner-friendly language, so you can improve your cup every single day.</p>
            
            <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">1. Understanding the Basics</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Freshness matters:</strong> Coffee tastes best when it’s fresh. Once beans are roasted, they slowly lose their flavour and aroma. If you can, start with freshly roasted beans and grind them right before brewing. Even small changes in freshness can massively improve your cup.</li>
                <li><strong>The grind size:</strong> The grind size controls how long the water needs to extract flavour from the coffee.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fine grind – best for espresso and moka pots.</li>
                        <li>Medium grind – good for pour-overs, filter machines and AeroPress.</li>
                        <li>Coarse grind – perfect for French press and cold brew.</li>
                        <li>As a rule of thumb: too fine = bitter, too coarse = weak.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>The golden ratio:</strong> 1 gram of coffee for every 15–17 grams of water. This gives a balanced cup. Adjust to taste, but this ratio keeps things consistent.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">2. The Four Essentials of a Good Brew</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Quality Beans:</strong> Pick beans that match your taste preference. Light roasts are brighter and fruitier, medium roasts are balanced, and dark roasts are bolder with deeper chocolate notes.</li>
                <li><strong>Clean Water:</strong> Coffee is 98% water, so the quality really matters. Use filtered water if possible. If your water tastes great on its own, it’s good for coffee.</li>
                <li><strong>Correct Temperature:</strong> The ideal range is 92–96°C. Too hot = bitter. Too cool = flat. If you don’t have a thermometer, boil the kettle and let it sit for 30 seconds.</li>
                <li><strong>Even Extraction:</strong> Extraction is how much flavour gets pulled from the coffee. Stir gently, pour evenly, and ensure the grounds are soaked to avoid “dry pockets” that cause uneven flavour.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">3. Beginner-Friendly Brewing Methods</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pour-Over:</strong> Great for clarity, sweetness, and control.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Rinse your filter with hot water.</li>
                        <li>Add medium-ground coffee.</li>
                        <li>Pour gently in circles.</li>
                        <li>Aim for a total brew time of 2:30–3:30.</li>
                        <li>Why it’s good for beginners: teaches you how water flow affects flavour.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>French Press:</strong> Rich, full-bodied, and simple.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Add coarse grounds.</li>
                        <li>Pour in hot water.</li>
                        <li>Wait 4 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Slowly press down the plunger.</li>
                        <li>Why it’s good for beginners: almost impossible to mess up.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>AeroPress:</strong> Fast, forgiving, and versatile.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Add coffee and water.</li>
                        <li>Stir.</li>
                        <li>Press gently after 1–2 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Why beginners love it: consistency and portability.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">4. Common Mistakes to Avoid</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Using stale beans:</strong> If the coffee tastes flat, this is usually the reason.</li>
                <li><strong>Grinding incorrectly:</strong> This is the most common beginner mistake. Don’t be afraid to experiment and adjust.</li>
                <li><strong>Rushing the brew:</strong> Let the water do its job. Good coffee takes a little patience.</li>
                <li><strong>Ignoring measurements:</strong> Eyeballing can work, but a simple digital scale takes your brewing from random to reliable.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">5. How to Develop Your Own Coffee Style</h3>
            <p>This is where coffee gets truly fun. Once you’ve got the basics down, start experimenting:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Try the same beans with different grind sizes.</li>
                <li>Play with brewing times.</li>
                <li>Compare light, medium, and dark roasts.</li>
                <li>Try beans from different regions (Ethiopia vs Brazil, etc).</li>
                <li>Brew the same coffee using different methods.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As you experiment, your taste buds will sharpen, and you’ll quickly learn what you actually enjoy — not just what you’re “supposed” to like.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">6. Vocabulary Every Beginner Should Know</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Extraction:</strong> how much flavour is pulled from the grounds.</li>
                <li><strong>Body:</strong> the weight and texture of the coffee.</li>
                <li><strong>Acidity:</strong> brightness or “sparkle” in the cup.</li>
                <li><strong>Bloom:</strong> the first pour where CO₂ escapes and the grounds puff up.</li>
                <li><strong>Crema:</strong> the golden foam on top of espresso.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These terms help you describe what you’re tasting and understand what needs adjusting.</p>

            <p>Brewing coffee at home shouldn’t feel complicated or intimidating. Start simple, adjust slowly, and trust your own taste. What matters most is the cup you enjoy, not strict rules or perfect technique.</p>
            <p>Whether you're using a French press on a quiet morning or experimenting with a new pour-over recipe, brewing coffee is an experience — not just a routine. Take your time, taste everything, and have fun with it.</p>
